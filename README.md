### Hello World ?
I am veterinary diagnostician and team leader in one of the largest veterinary laboratories in Poland.
<br>I have 3+ years of experience in this industry and after this time, I decided to make some changes.
<br>I have been interested in IT industry for several years.
<br>Previously, I treated programming as a hobby, but now I want to turn my interest into job. That's my goal!
